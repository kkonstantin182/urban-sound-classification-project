## General info
This is the project for the course "Statistical Methods for Machine Learning" at the University of Milan.
The task can be found ([here](https://github.com/kkonstantin182/urban-sound-classification-project/blob/main/task.pdf)).
The project describes the application of convolutional neural networks on the example of a multiclass classification problem. 
The work portrays the process of extracting features from sound waves, tuning hyperparameters, and also provides classification results for two convolutional neural network architectures.

## Technologies
